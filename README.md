## Run your own!
If you're looking to run your own, firstly download the [latest relase](https://github.com/KiloSierraCharlie/OffsetXX/releases) (or if you're feeling a little more experimental, clone the current repo). Place it straight into the web directory where you want it to display, and setup a cron job for the necessary file.
